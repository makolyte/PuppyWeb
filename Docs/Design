Ok, so i'm going to break the Problem Statement down into concrete tasks
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Main objective: Design a website that allows people to adopt puppies from shelters

Udacity objectives to achieve
1. All CRUD operations on Puppies, Shelters, and Owners
2. Switching or Balancing Shelter Population and Protecting against overflows
3. Viewing a Puppy Profile
4. Adopting a New Puppy
5. Creating and Styling Templates (optionally with Bootstrap)
6. Adding Flash Messages
BONUS: Pagination

PAGES
Shelters
--minimize scope by removing shelter "capacity"

1. CREATE - Page with form for creating a shelter record
   /shelter/create

2. READ
    a. A page that lists all shelters
    /shelters
    b. A page that shows a specific shelter's profile
    /shelter/shelter_id
3. UPDATE
    a. A form that allows you to edit the shelter info
    /shelter/shelter_id/edit
4. DELETE
    /shelter/shelter_id/delete -- does this really need to be its own page?


Puppies
Because these are contained by shelters, all specific
puppy actions are within the context of a shelter, therefore
the url will contain shelter + puppy

1. CREATE - Page with a form for all puppy fields, including shelter.
   /shelter/shelter_id/puppy/create
2. READ -
    a. Page that lists puppies for a shelter or all puppies.
    Show puppy pic, name, and a link to the puppy profile
    b. Puppy Profile shows a specific puppy
    links to edit/delete. There's no access control to these, because this is a
    practice site.

    /puppies = all puppies
    /shelter/shelter_id/puppies = puppies for a shelter
    /shelter/shelter_id/puppy/puppy_id = puppy profile

3. UPDATE - Edit the info for a puppy record
   /shelter/shelter_id/puppy/puppy_id/edit
4. DELETE - Delete an existing puppy record
    /shelter/shelter_id/puppy/puppy_id/delete



Owners
This will be simple. When you adopt a puppy, it will have a form for you to fill
out owner info
1. ADOPTION - A form for confirming adoption and entering your name/address
    /shelter/shelter_id/puppy/puppy_id/adopt
    a. Create the owner record
    b. Update the puppy record, setting Shelter_ID=null and owner_id = owner


STYLE
Use bootstrap and create a grid layout.



RELATIONSHIPS
Puppies belong to either a Shelter or an Owner
Shelters contain multiple Puppies
Owners contain multiple Puppies
